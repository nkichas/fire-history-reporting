Dispatched Old Faithful RVP staff with structure fire engine to investigate report and take initial action if warranted.  Troy Shaffer reported…The fire was located approximately 100 feet from the loop road for the picnic area. The fire was located in the duff behind a log away from the designated picnic sites. No sign of a fire being intentionally built or a fire ring being created. Myself, Michael Curtis, and Eric Wight doused the fire with water and dug up the dirt and duff to ensure it was completely out. The closest guesses I have to guess the cause would be either someone smoking while using the bathroom or lighting their TP on fire after completing their business. Seem like an out of place location for a fire. I looked for any possible evidence of a cause or exact origin and was unable to locate anything of significance.

8/11/20 1730 hours Fire is declared controlled and out.

the western boundary of the park. The reporting party saw smoke just east of Divide Lake. 2TC
was launched from Mammoth Helispot. A grizzly was spotted on the Quadrant Plateau. First orbit over the approximate spot no smoke was visible but we could smell it. After a second orbit we were able to locate the smoke on the lower ⅓ of a north facing slope. Called in a fire size up to dispatch from
the front seat. He ordered the Jumpers out of West for backup. Jumper 13 was flying to the west
on a daily detection flight. 700 Fox informed us D.O. named the fire, Divide Springs. At
1100, 2TC located a helispot and we unloaded 2TC and we set up the bucket. We got lined
out established LCES while 2TC hit the Divide Springs Fire with buckets. With the Gallatin
River just to the north of the fire, 2TC had a very quick turnaround time. 
1115 we arrived at the fire. At 1130, Jump 13 arrived with 8 jumpers.
By 1240 2TC was sent back to Swan Flats to refuel, take a lunch, and remain on standby. Bucket was contaminated by Yellowstone Aquatic Invasive Species Staff later in the day. The Divide Springs was called contained at 1420. All personnel cold trailed the fire. Weather had been building throughout the afternoon and it did not make sense to have 2TC pick up personnel or sling cargo. At 1515, all forestry technicians left the fireline and the fire was called controlled. Jumpers had to make two trips to hike their gear out.

Using the Lat Long we got from the recon we found a suitable pullout spot nearest to the fire at approximately 2010. The location of the fire 44 28.4600N 110 33.5474 W.
The hike in took around 20 min and when we got there we I checked in with dispatch and we proceeded to dig line around the hottest parts of the fire, the fire is very much a mosaic with fingers of green throughout. It is approximately .1 acres in size with slow creeping and smoldering in the duff and in some heavy down logs, we worked the fire using helmets to dip out of the creek at the heel of the fire and in about 45 min we had a line around the hottest areas and the majority of the fire. There is one large, tall snag in the fire that is of concern as a hazard tree, it had smoldering around 15 feet up it. I marked it with orange flagging. 
At around 2120 we hiked out and flagged our route out to the road. This should be used to access the fire again unless there is a better route. I recommend a team of 6 with one saw and a trash pumps with 4 rolls of hose to fully mop up. The small stream could support the pump and is right next to the heel of the fire.

7/31/21
Initial attack took place on Saturday the 31st with 2TC dropping off two firefighters, they started sawing and utilizing buckets. At this time we were on the way from Mammoth. When we got there it started raining heavily with thunder and lightening in close proximity. The ship set down for safety and resources pulled back off the fire for about 45 min. After the heaviest rain had subsided we hiked back in which was when the fire was handed off to me. I made the decision to use 2 saws and start cutting out heavies and trees around the perimeter of the fire. After about 45 min 2TC felt safe in re-engaging with the bucket and I directed drops on parts of the fire that were of highest concern. I released the ship back to Mammoth so that he could be back by 8pm. At about 8:50 we had tied in the saw line around the perimeter and had established a line around the North flank of the fire. I ordered an engine and a hand crew for the next operational shift. All resources were off the line by approximately 9:00 pm.
8/1/21
Jumpers arrived on scene at 8am and hiked into the fire and started saw work to improve the effectiveness of the saw cut. Heavies interior were also bucked and snags were removed. By 9am we had a hand line around the perimeter of the fire and began bone piling. After scouting for closer access for the engines we began the hose lay from the parking area at 1030 and had water flowing by 1130. Mop up with water proceeded. At 230 2 jumpers were pulled for a new start in the park. At 330 we began pulling hose off the line. At 4 I released the remaining jumpers back to West Yellowstone. We continued to monitor for smoke and shortly after 5 headed back to Mammoth.

By 1535 launched 2TC with 3 onboard. Headwinds made for slow progress as we crossed the Washburn Range. We made several passes over the coordinates we were given but no hints of fire activity. At 1405 we set down in a meadow on the west bank of Cascade Lake. We unloaded and grided the hillside looking for the fire, but we were unable to locate it.  called 700 Fox for any more information and we learned the fire was 150 yards southwest of campside 4E2 across the meadows. This immediately changed our search location. We got back on the Cascade Lake Trail as we thought it was most likely where the reporting party spotted it from. At 1620, spotted it across the marsh, and with a gust of wind the smoke was gone. We got to the single tree fire at 1625. It was evident the 15 foot stovepipe tree needed to come down. made quick work of it. We gridded the green for any embers that might have come off the stovepipe, none were found. The only heat was found in the strike tree. We dry mopped, and used water bottles to cool the heat.  At 1715, the fire was called contained. The fire was cold as we walked off the line at 1725.

Due to the extreme fire season, all fires were in a suppression mode in Yellowstone.  The fire was initial attacked by   4 smokejumpers out of West Yellowstone jump base at 1339 and they were         supported by a heavy air tanker out of West and by the 6 person Sandia         Helitack crewthat was stationed in Yellowstone at the time.  The fire was 3    acres at report and was 5 acres and growing rapidly at initial attack.  The    fire escaped the IA efforts and a Type II IMT was ordered.  Ernie Johnson's    Blue Ridge IMT from R-6 was assigned.                                           The IMT was successful in containing the fire at about 4,000 acres and the     fire was transitioned back to the park.  The park crew assigned to the fire    continue to mopup but unfortunately began to also rehab some of the fireline.  Due to the mopup not being 100% complete, the Robinson fire esaped             containment and massive suppression efforts had to be undertaken once again.   Helitack and jumpers again were called in but the fire quickly escaped and a   second Type II IMT was called in.  Tim Hancock's Eastside IMT was assigned.    A large effort was once again undertaken to suppress this fire, mainly at the  urging of the Targhee NF, as they were concerned the fire would burn back into their forest.                                                                   The Team flanked the fire and was supported by the Yellowstone Helitack crew   shooting FLE along the NW flank to secure that flank.  Precip was received on  several days with a significant snowstorm on 10/2/94.  The fire was declared   contained and all suppression forces were demobed.  The fire was controlled    on 10/14/94 at 1800 at 8,482 acres and was declared out on 10/31/04.",,,,,,,,,,,639149,11/1/1994 6:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:03 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:03 PM,,0,,44.21659,-111.08411,,9/9/1994 7:39:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,000056,,8/2/2006 6:00:00 AM,,,,,Fremont,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-ID,,,480101,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jed was not available for an interview.

The fire was confirmed as a single aspen tree with no other trees a round it. The plan was to fly the fire since it was located on the south side  of the Lamar River and there is no bridge access an no safe ford area.

Suppression action was taken due to teh extreme fire season and a national     preparedness level of 5.

The fire escaped IA and since it was in a remote area of the park and in a     Fire Use zone, a containment strategy was selected as the appropriate          management strategy.  This action reduced firefighter exposure, did not        require a massive suppression resource response, and saved considerable        dollars.  The Plateau fire was monitored for the remainderof the fire season   with no additional suppression action taken.

Washburn lookout.    The fire smoked up for a short period of time and then died down and was not   located or seen again until the afternoon of 7/5.  The fire was flown by the   Park FMO and AFMO and jumpers and air tankers were ordered.  The wx conditions were too windy to jump so all IA operations were psotponed until 7/6.  On 7/6, the AFMO plus 5 ff IA'd the fire and cut an operational helispot.  Retardant   was dropped but the fire grew steadily all day to about 240 acres.  On 7/7 the IA crew shot 3200' of FLE and made good progress even though winds were strong Additional resources were secured for 7/8 and 20 ff were flown into thefire    but a passing cold front with winds over 35mph created unsafe conditions for   the extended attack to continue.  All ff were demobed and a fire Use team was  ordered.                                                                        The fire was monitored on 7/9 and 7/10.  The FUMT reconned the fire on the     afternoon and began making their fire behavior calculations and long-term      analyses.  At 0710 on 7/11 with the fire at approx 2500 acres, Cook's FUMT     recommended that a Type I team be ordered.                                      The Type I Team (Frye's) arrived the afternoon on 7/12 and were briefed.  The  fire was approx. 5,000 acres.  A safe operational plan was developed and       implementation began on 7/13 with direct attack at the SW corner of the fire   tieing into the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and using Type I helicopters   to drop water on the fire burning in the canyon and threatening to cross to    the west side of the Yellowstone river.  The direct attack was immediately     successfl and steady progress was made working counter-clockwise around the    fire and leap frogging spike camps and crews.  Some afternoon rain showers     assisted the suppression efforts until the fire was contained and the Type I   team was demobbed on 7/26.                                                      The Park assumed command again on 7/26 with a Type 3 organization that         continued to hit the hot spots and smokes and monitoring the fire until        significant rain was received in early September.  The fire continue to        smolder in the interior portions and the fire was monitored by the Mt.         Washburn lookout and overflights unti it was declared out.

IA   forces were in other locations in the park and smokejumpers were requested.    8 jumpers were dropped at 1830 with the fire at approximately 20.0 acres in    size by that time.  These 8 jumpers were reinforced by 4 additional jumpers    and several retardant drops were made.  The fire was exposed to strong SW      winds being at the top of Amethyst Ridge and the fire was spreading by long-   range spotting.  The jumpers were reinforced by 8 more jumpers at 0700 on      7/16 with the fire at 20-25 acres.  The winds picked up during the day and     it was determined that the jumpers would not catch the fire.  The jumpers      were demobbed at 1600 by the park helicopter, the FMO flew the fire and a      WFSA was completed.  The WFSA called for 2 crews with local helitack and 2     additional helicopters to support the fire to keep it on the south side of     Specimen Ridge and out of the Lamar Valley.  Tim Klukas took over as ICT3 on   7/17 with 2 20-person crews, 1 light, 1 light and 1 heavy helicopter for       support.  Direct suppression efforts were taken and with the help of some      rainfall these resources were successful in containing the fire on 7/28/03     at 315.0 acres.

This fire grew very quickly as Frank Island, and island of    638 acres had not burned in over 300 years.  The Park FMO witnessed the        initial growth of this fire while on the Grizzly Fire and immediately          declared this fire a WFU, as it was located on an island in the middle of      Yellowstone Lake.  It was not safe to attempt to suppress this fire because    the terrain was flat with no escape routes.                                     The fires spread quickly in the dense fuels, driven by strong,gusty thunder-   storm winds.  The fire burned intensely for 4-5 days, smoking in much of the   southern part of Yellowstone Lake, as well as the Lake and Grant Village       developed areas.  The fire was monitored by the Lake Rangers, boat patrol      rangers, the Mt. Sheridan lookout and fixed-wing overflights.                   The fire burned throughout August and September as it was burning in the       1000-hour fuels.

DUE TO HERBACEOUS FUEL MOISTUREIN THE MEADOWS AND ROCKY RIDGELINE THE FIRE     DID NOT GROW MUCH AFTER 8/12.  A CAMP WAS SET UP, SUPPLIED BY HELICOPTER AND   BOAT, AND WAS SUPERVISED BY A CAMP MANAGER.  THE RIDGELINE CONTINUED TO SHEL-  TER THE FIRE FROM PREVAILING WINDS AND THAT ALSO HAMPERED FIRE GROWTH.  AN ON  SCENE WAETHER STATION INDICATED THE MFWS HAD TO BE IN EXCESS OF 10 MPH TO PROD UCE GROWTH ALONG WITH HUMIDITY RANGES BELOW 25% AND TEMPS AROUND 70 DEGREES    WERE NEEDED FOR PERIMETER GROWTH.  THE FIRE WAS STAFFED WITH MONITORS, AND THE FIRE USE MODULE AND A CAMP MANAGER UNTIL 8/24.  FOLLOWING THAT, THE FIRE WAS   MONITORED AERIALLY AND WITH LOOKOUTS.  THE FIRE CAMP WAS PULLED ON 9/05 AND    THE PALM IR FLIGHT ON 9/06 STILL DETECTED HEAT IN TWO POCKETS OF HEAVY FUELS.  FIRE SHELTER WRAP FROM THE SEISMIC STATION WAS REMOVED IN LATE SEPT.

This fire met all the parameters for a WFU and was managed as such until being declared out on 10/23/06 at 3,235 acres.  The FMO completed a WFIP Stage II analysis on 7/18/06 as the fire made about a 100 acre run that afternoon.  The Magpie Fire was located in the Central Plateau FMU and was surrounded by heavy 1988 burned area.  Andy Mitchell and Tim Klukas also served as FUMA's during the management of this fire and Andy completed the Stage III WFIP analysis with assistance from Roy Renkin who did the LTAN fire behavior analysis including RERAP and FARSITE runs.  Roy was able to be signed off as an LTAN this summer with assistance from Chip Collins from GRTE.  Roy Hall's SW FUMT reviewed Andy's Stage III as well as the IMR office and it was approved. The fire behavior did not warrant going into a Stage III management and the fire was managed as a Stage II WFU it's entire duration.  The Mary Mt. cabin was wrapped with fire shelter material and a WUI and hazard tree work was done in conjunction with the management of this fire.  The Yell helitack crew, fire monitors and FUM were involved in all aspects of managing this fire.  Ryan Tripp developed a remote starter pump system, to remotely start the portable pump located at the cabin via remote start from the helicopter so as not to place firefighters at risk to start the pump and fly or hike out from the cabin.

It started just south of the WY/MT border, and quickly burned north into MT.  After the fire burned across the East Fork of Specimen Creek, it moved into much more rugged and steeper terrain.    A Type 2 Incident Management Team was ordered.  Tony Wilder's IMTeam (from the Southeast) assumed command of the fire at 0800 on July 25.  Heavy rains on or about the 27th and 28th greatly reduced fire behavior to the point of hiding most remaining heat.  Some mop-up and line construction activities proceed to contain previously active areas     Portions of the fire burned in areas previously burned in 1988.  On August 6th fire management transitioned to a Type 3 organization led by YNP AFMO, Andy Mitchell.  The fire did not exhibit further growth, however drying conditions prevailed.  smokejumpers were called in later that week to control a 2 acre flare up near the control line that threatened to spot into the green.  They were subsequently relieved on the 17th of August by a BLM T2 handcrew and Yellowstone militia to complete mop-up.  The BLM creww spiked in the area for 2 nights leaving the 19th.    Yellowstone helitack joined Yellowstone trails staff that same day to patrol and intiate fire rehab activities.

Monitors on the ground were from YNP helitack, monitors, and fire use module members.  The fire had a stage III document prepared and reviewed by the Shoshone N.F..  A RAWS station was installed near this fire due to service relocation needs and not because of the fire, Cabin Creek RAWS formerly Thorofare RAWS.  The fuels at the cabin were bucked up for pile burning and fire wood.  Crews were not able to burn the piles and that fuel treatment will require completion at a later date and an edit to this report.  Significance of this fire? The fire was allowed to burn where fires were previously put out due to alleged concerns about conducting WFU fires with the Shoshone NF, example Tyson Fire 2003 in the same drainage. Fire opened up more WFU possibilities with the SNF on the eastern boundary.  Ecological process was unhindered.  Fire was south of the Columbine Fire and burned with less intensity in the same time period.  Fuel models and precip timing accounted for less intensity on the Beaverdam Fire.  The Beaverdam Fire stayed within the Park as predicted by fire analysts, Doug Stephens, Pat Stephens, Roy Renkin, Tim Klukas, and Rick O'Connell, SNF.  The Fire was a long duration event for which no near misses, injuries or accidents occured.  The Mt. Sheridan Lookout was the primary source of daily validation for this fire meeting WFIP objectives.  Aviation was minimal and about twice weekly rotary or fixed wing, tapering to once a week for mapping updates.  Trainees John Morlock and Jeff Hickerson were supervised by FUMA Tim Klukas. Support provided by Plans Chief, Gabbert.  Fuels work provided by Mitchell.  In general, daily correspondence occured with the N. Zone FMO, Clint Dawson.  The Fire only briefly crossed the North side of Beaverdam Creek and a shower put that spot fire out. A unpredicted northwesterly flow kept the fire confined on the south side of Beaverdam Creek. This area has a bit of a micro climate and an unexpected wind flow wrapping around the Promontory. Fire was a successful WFU.",,,,,,DTG7,,,,,639482,10/8/2007 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.3357,-110.1295,,7/23/2007 5:00:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,000712,,10/29/2007 6:00:00 AM,,,,,Park,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,480118,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All were on ""The Promontory"" in the south end of Yellowstone Lake and were started by lightning.  The three fires burned together on (08-16-2007) and were then known as the Promontory Complex.  A Stage 1 and 2 Wildland Fire Implementation Plan was completed and the decision was made to manage the merged fire as a fire use fire.  The fire only burned about 4% of the total complex acreage, most of it occurring on 8/16 and 8/17/07.  Significance of the Fire? Until 2004, the Park had been putting fires out on the Promontory.  In 2004, a moderate intensity WFU was allowed to burn.  The complex received no resistance to allow this fire to burn from area Ranger Michael Keator, or other supervisory divisions. The fire closed down several campsites for extended time periods.  The unburned control plot installed in 2004 was completely burned over in 2007. The fire was primarily managed by trainees, John Morlock and later Jeff Hickerson.  The duty officer at the MWRO was J. Duhnkrack supporting the planning level 5 approval.  Fuels work at Trail Creek was completed by Ryder and Kortge and supervised by Mitchell. Follow up work remains to be completed at Trail Creek for pile burning.  The fire report will need to be updated to reflect the costs of finishing the fuels treatment.  Monitoring work was completed by Scott Weyenberg, Becky Smith, Carla Minneti, Phil Graeve, and Devin Jones.  A new plot was put in place south of the main burn.  The old plot was read.  The monitors used the Trail Creek Cabin and canoes.  A seismic station was burned up.  The Yellowstone Volcanic Observatory equipment was known to be in the field due to the previous Promontory Fire,2004'.  Firefighters ran out of time to protect the equipment and the intense torching melted the solar panels and a power inverter.  A GPS unit, and underground seismic unit was saved with shelter wrap.  Food poles on other campsites were burned up.  A plastic toilet was saved along with a wooden toilet.  NO campsites were snagged for rehab. This will be evaluated following the winter of 2007/2008 by the area ranger. The fire growth on the Promontory was occuring on the same days the big Columbine Fire got up and running.  The column from the Promontory shaded and slowed fire growth on the Columbine Fire during a big burning period and kept the Columbine Fire from significantly trespassing into Canfield Creek.  Hobos were put out to monitor weather data.  The Cabin Creek RAWS represented conditions well.  The lookout on Mt. Sheridan provided daily updates on this fire to the FUMA, W. Neumeister.  Monitoring was by boat and air. Mapping flights were infrequent. There were no helicopter landings for this fire.  Lake Maintenance provided a lot of boat support and the fuels program packed horses in as well to reduce noise/flights.  This narrative is applicable to the other Promontory events of 2007.  This was a successful Complex of WFU fires.  Total Complex of Fires was 1638 acres.

The 200 acre figure is an approximate guess of its acreage before merging with the Promontory NW Fire on August 11.  The fire report in 2007 for the Promontory Complex details the personnel primarily involved in the incident and highlights.  200 acres burned on Promontory NE before merging.  Promontory NW burned approximately 590 acres final, but when these fire merged it was for around 450 acres and kept growing.  The Promontory S. only grew around 60 acres. The remaining +1300 acres grew on the perimeters of Promontory NE and Promontory NW.  The acreage estimate for growth on each fire was not very accurate due to a lack of aerial resources to map the fires.  Promontory S was a slow expanding fire that finally spread after August 15 and then lost momemtum.  Seasonal rains moved in on the fires, Aug. 17, but smokes were still seen in late September before the lookout (W. Neumeister) came down in early October.

Air Attack 45Y from the Columbine 1 fire was dispatched to the Huckleberry fire for a better fire size up.  Upon arrival 45Y reported the fire to be 1/4 acre, smoldering and begining to torch.  Duty officer Mitchell was advised of location, size and fire behavior.  Air Attack 45Y was released to the Columbine Fire at this time.  At 1347 Mitchell advised dispatch of the decision to suppress the Huckleberry Fire.  A load of smokejumpers was ordered at 1347.  At that time, a loaded Tanker 43 was enroute back to WYS airport after weather prevented a drop on the Shoshone National Forest.  Tanker 43 was then diverted to drop on the Huckleberry by Air Attack B56, which was back in the air and over the Huckleberry at that time.  At 1425 the fire was reported to be 2-3 acres with most of the activity on the N/NE flank.  Tanker 43 was ordered to load and return, and Tanker 22 was ordered to load and return to the Huckleberry after dropping on the Columbine 1.    At 1504 Jumper 13 arrived on scene with 8 jumpers on board.  All jumpers and cargo were dropped and communication with the ICT4(T)(Stanzack with ICT3 Lannan) was established at 1603.  Retardent drops continued and a helicopter and pump equipment were ordered by the IC at 1604.  Due to unavailability of helicopters, a jumper paracargo mission out of West Yellowstone was put into motion.  At 1655 additional supplies for pump operations were ordered and passed onto the jump base.  At 1732, the IC ordered another load of jumpers or a 20 person crew, neither of which were available at that time.  The Park helicopter 0US was made available to assist with some bucket work and the jump plane completed the paracargo resource order and all aircraft were clear of the fire at 1905.  Jumpers worked the fire until 2400 and put in a resource order to double the original order.  At 0800 on 8/12/07, a load of smokejumpers was ordered by dispatch, Jumper 12 arrived on scene and had 8 additional jumpers on the ground by 0939.  Jumper 13 completed the second paracargo mission at 1020.  Helicopter 0US provided an additional resource delivery and some bucket work.  Columbine Air Attack checked the fire during shift changes and the jumpers worked the fire through the day and were off at 2200.    On 8/13/2007 the jumpers worked interior smokes and planned a demob of 8 jumpers for the next morning, the fire was estimated to be 23 acres.  On 8/14/2007, 8 jumpers were demobed mid day after completing a grid of the fire.  Their gear was slung to the South Entrance by Helicopter 0US while the jumpers hiked out.  The fire was called contained at 2000 hours that night.  Eight jumpers remained on the fire through the night.  They gridded the fire again on the 15th, then finished preparing the backhaul.  Helo 0US hauled the gear to the South Entrance as the jumpers hiked out, and the fire was put into patrol status.  The fire was monitored by the Sheridan Lookout and by Columbine Air Attack, and no smokes were observed.

Fire had smoldered for a few days.  Aircraft spotted the fire on 9-09, commercial air.  Later on 9-10, Park bird flight survey personnel spotted the fire and called it in around 3 acres.  Midday, FUMA and HEMG flew in Park helicopter to scene.  On the ground assessment showed no litter, debris, campfire or suspect cause.  Evidence indicated the fire had crept around for 3 burn periods before on the ground monitors arrived.  Recent rains at Bechler (RAWS) indicated around 1 inch had fallen.  This constrained fire behavior.  Fire was allowed to burn due to on the ground burning characteristics.  Torching was minimal.  This was a classic pine understory burn that steadily progressed to +200 acres.  Winds and red flag days helped move the fire, however, the fire never made canopy runs or had long range spotting.  The area had old fir stands with a lodgepole stand spread evenly apart.  Perhaps earlier fires or anthropogenic burning had the stand in this conditions.  West Yell. Smoke Jumpers staffed the fire for a few days as monitors and then overlapped with Yellowstone Fire use module.  Module was pulled out on the 15th to assist with the Norris burn.  It became apparent the fire was likely to stay on the ground, so trail closure needs or the need to monitor Union Falls parking area was not needed.  Heavy bear sign indicated it was not wise to continue staffing the fire.  Fire went out naturally following November and October precip events.  Bechler RAWS was the representative station.

These two active fires burned +1300 acres. The Promontory NE fire claimed the most acres due to some local winds pushing that fire down the east shore of the Promontory.   The fire was monitored on the ground, by boat and air.   This was a fire use fire managed by more than one FUMA.  FUMAS were Klukas, Morlock, Hickerson. Fuels treatment was initiated at Trail Creek.  No helicopter landings occured in the field.  Fire was the likely culprit of the Seismic stations burnover and damage.

I redevoused at the cache with Tim Klukas, whom would act as the IC for the operational period.  Kraus and Klukas drove from Mammoth to the Round Prairie area and met with Brian Chan, District Ranger for Lamar and befan to gather intelligence from Chan and civilians who had seen smoke and had spotting scopes on the area the smoke had last been seen.  No smoke was visible but from witness descriptions we narrowed the possivle fire area down to an area on the map south of Round Prairie across the Soda Butte creek.  Kraus and Klukas then discussed access and saf3ety issues associated with the various options.  The only bridge access was at Lamar TH which would include an approx 5 mile hike to the fire area.  Due to the distance, time of day, and an area known as grizzly bear habitat, it was deemed to be not feasible for that day but left open as an option for the following day.  The Chief Ranger stated that rafts of other watercraft would not be used to cross Soda Butte creek, so our other option would be to ford Soda Butte creek above the confluence with Pebble Creek where the creek was wider and thus possibly safer.  Kraus and Klukas then hiked to the river to inspect ir for possible spots to ford.  Chan provided PFD's and was set up donwriver with a throw line for safety.  Upon further inspection and non-emergent response to the fire Karus and Klukas concluded that the ford was not the safest option and abandoned that plan before attempting to cross the snowmelt swollen creek.  On 5/31 Kraus and Page hiked from Lamar TH to further search for reported smoke.  Upon arriving at the predetermined area based on witness accounts from the previous day, both Kraus and Page could smell the faintest odor of smoke in the air.  The winds were not srong b ut erratic and pinpointing the source was proving difficult.  It then began to rain.  After approx 45 minutes fo rain the smell of smoke was no longer detected.  The weather continued to deteriorate and storm cells began to develop in the area.  As the winde picked up in intesity and speed it was deemed no longer safe to be in the forest and the search was abandoned.",,,,,,EX35,,,,,639504,6/25/2009 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.9011,-110.1175,,5/30/2009 11:30:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,000901,,8/10/2009 6:00:00 AM,,,,,Park,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Engine 1570 with three (Kraus, Tobin, Jones) was also dispatched from Mammoth. After arriving at the parking area for the Indian Pond trail and not observing any smoke Nelson and Page discussed LCES and started hiking toward Lake Yellowstone on the Indian Pond trail. Once we arrived at the lake shore the smoldering tree was spotted. It was a lightning struck ~28� Doug fir with the top broken off standing 10 feet off the edge of the Lake. The surrounding fuels were very green grass in the immediate vicinity and a stringer of timber 75 yards away. The duff and litter in the timber was very damp and Indian Pond was adjacent on the opposite side. Spread potential was observed to be very low. No flames were observed at the time but volunteers said that they had seen flames earlier in the day. Winds at the time were ~20mph out of the SSW, temp was 69, and RH was 22. 	It was determined that this would be a suppression fire so it was requested that E-1570 bring a saw and pump with them when they hiked in. Once E-1570 was on scene they received a briefing, LCES was discussed and they went to work. The tree was felled and a pump was set up to mop up the smoldering rounds. The area was observed for about one half hour to determine if any smoke would pop up. No smoke showed so the crew covered the stump and cut ends of the logs with green limbs to screen them from view of visitors on the lake. All resources were released at 1800 and the fire was called contained.   FMO/Duty Officer comments:  Phone calls were made to the Chief Ranger after the initial report came in.  Information regarding location, weather, proximity to road and the lake were discussed.  We decided to wait until resources were on scene before making a decision regarding extinguish or monitor.  After size-up information was passed along to dispatch, the decision to extinguish this fire was made by the duty officer and chief ranger.  Reasons given to extinguish this fire were:  1) the fire was pretty close to a road and even though it could not be seen on that day due to high winds keeping the smoke down, this would have been a nuisance fire in terms of impacts to local ranger operations. 2) the fire was surrounded on three sides by Yellowstone Lake, a very wet bog and the road.  3) the proximity to the lake provided unlimited water and minimal exposure to risk from a firefighter safety perspective.",,,,,,E1VH,,,,,639506,7/16/2009 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.554783,-110.325333,,7/13/2009 10:30:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,000903,,8/10/2009 6:00:00 AM,,,,,Park,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The visitor reported seeing smoke and estimated the fire to be several acres at that time from the Shoshone Lake Overlook at approx. 1522 hrs.  Kraus (ICT4 trainee) and Kreutzer responded in the park ship (N230US) leaving the Mammoth Helibase at approx. 1600hrs after gathering helpful information from 700 Fox (Fire Dispatch).    Due to concerns with the visit of President Barack Obama in several days and the proximity of the fire to the designated Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) associated with the Presidential visit, it was decided before the firefighters left the fire cache that the fire would be a suppression fire.  This decision made for easier preplanning for the firefighters responding to the fire.  0US with Kraus and Kreutzer were in the fire area and conducting size-up at approx. 1630 hrs.    After completing a size-up and relaying that information to 700 Fox suppression action was initiated.  After finding a safe landing zone near the Delacey Creek trail, Kraus and Kreutzer attached the bucket to the helicopter and 0US began attacking the fire with buckets while the firefighters hiked into the fire.  LCES was discussed and implemented with a ranger acting as a lookout from the Shoshone Lake Overlook.  Communications with 700 Fox quickly became a challenge and it was decided the lookout would act as a relay with dispatch.  Escape routes were flagged to a meadow close to the fire which would act as a Safety Zone if needed.  An anchor point was established and a plan developed to cut saw line around the fire since it was burning predominantly in thee heavy load of dead and down while 0US continued bucket work.  This proved to be effective in gaining the upper hand on the fire.  The fire was then mapped by GPS and was .1 acre in size.  At 1645, 10 West Yellowstone Smokejumpers arrived at Delacey Creek Trailhead and all other responding resources were turned around.  Firefighters Chartier and Urrutia also responded from Grant developed area, and due to their fire experience, it was determined to use them as lookout/relay for the remaining daylight hours.  Once the jumpers arrived on scene, we regrouped and cleared the fire area so that 0US could safely finish his fuel cycle with firefighters clear of the drop zone.  0US was off scene at 1915 and the fire line was improved and mop-up initiated.  The crew continued to work on the fire until darkness began to fall on the area and it was deemed unsafe to continue mop-up.  The crew hooched up for a chilly, but relatively bug free coyote spike.  At first light, communications were again established with 700 Fox and mop-up continued with cold trailing and a thorough grid of the fire and surrounding area.  No lightning struck tree was ever found, but splinters from a tree indicating a strike were found during the grid.    The fire was contained at 0930 on August 13, 2009.  Jumpers left the fire area at 1100hours while Kraus and Kreutzer remained to search out any remaining smokes.  Two more smokes were found and dealt with and Kraus and Kreutzer left the fire for pickup at the Delacey Creek Trailhead at 1300 hours.   On August 24, 2009 Kraus and Feathers hiked back into the fire and the Pocket Fire was called out at 1600 hours.",,,,,,E42Y,,,,,639513,8/25/2009 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.4325,-110.6942,,8/12/2009 10:33:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,000910,,8/27/2009 6:00:00 AM,,,,,Teton,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though the fire did not spread, there was considerable potential for it to spread due to the steepness of the slope and the heavy fuels at the base of the cliff face.",,,,,,E57E,,,,,639518,10/2/2009 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,45.0114,-110.015,,8/31/2009 1:36:00 AM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,000915,,11/12/2009 7:00:00 AM,,,,,Park,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-MT,,,,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fire was located near the top of the ridge and had no receptive fuel on the opposite slope. Only way for fire to progress was to have rolling debris ignite downhill and possibly make runs uphill and farther to the west. Not much potential for fire growth toward Cooke City with Cache creek drainage being fully burned out in 1988, as well as the fire having to go over Ampitheather Peak which is very sparcely vegetated.

Firefighters Kraus, Chartier, Oak, Clark, and Bush responded and hiked down from the Lava Creek trailhead near Undine Falls.  Upon arriving on scene a quick size-up revealed an area of duff under some Doug firs.  It was determined that helicopter bucked drops would be ineffective in aiding mop-up and that slinging in a pump would be slight overkill.  After chatting with Sprinkle it was determined that this was probably an unattended illegal fire.  No lightning tree was noted and the lightning maps showed no recent strikes in that area.  the fire was smoldering in duff so firefighters began to dry mop the fire with the aid of water transported in helmets from nearby Lava creek.

Joe Krish notified crew of fire and Doug Kraus, Kate Hall, Ryan Tripp, Todd Mott and Connor Vandersnick responded in Engine 1571 and a a second vehicle.  Crew arrived on scene at 1633 hours and it was decided by Doug Kraus that this would be a good fire for ICT5 training.  Connor Vandersnick was then appointed as ICT5 Trainee.  Crew had a briefing of operations and prepared equipment.  Fire was approximately 200 yards off road and crew hiked to fire for initial size up.  The fire was a single Douglas fir lightning strike with fire smoldering in center of tree.  Wind was less than 5 mph out of the southwest.  The tree was on the upper 1.3 of a 0-20% east aspect slope with grass and bush as adjacent fuels.  The area acquired approximately 14/"" to 1"" of rain in the past 24 hrs so it was decided that the spread potential was low.  Dispatch was given size up and it was decided to give the order to extinguish the fire at 1700 hrs.  Floating IC then assigned C Faller Ryan Tripp to fall the tree.  The tree was on the ground at 1720 hours.  Dirt was used to cool hot spots and the fire was contained at 1740 hours.  The Floating IC felt it was safe to leave the fire and then held and After Action Teview at 1815 hours.  In the AAR the crew decided that everything went as planned and the experienced personnel gave the ICT5 Trainee some pointers and constructive criticism.  The Floating IC then released the crew and all personnel were clear from the scene at 1820 hours. FMO comments:  The decision to extinguish this fire was made by the duty officer/fmo.  The reasons were:  too close to the road and a pullout, allowing potential visitors to stop and investigate the smoke.  This is a suppression zone in the original fire management plan.  Now was the time to put this out, rather than deal with the intensive management of what would amount to be a single burning snag.  The fire was checked again on 6/14/2011.

By 1100 on 7/26, park staff agreed this would be a good candidate for the Use of Wildland Fire,(UWF).  Throughout the summer this fire was monitored from a webcam that was placed atop Mt. Holmes, about 10 miles to the NW.  The fire was situated in a lodgepole pine canopy that was initially fairly open but transitioned to a more closed canopy as the fire backed to the south.  Fire behavior was very benign considering the surrounding fuel loading with only occasional single tree torching.  This likely was due to the high fuel moisture content from the very wet winter/spring.

The fire had been washed down by structural personel but had burned a 8�by 1� area following a decayed log up the slope.  There was no sign of heat or source of ignition.  Assumed to be man caused due to proximity of campsites and social trails.  No heat was found so Hafer and Vandersnick departed leaving Structural fire to continue their investigation.,,,,,,GB95,,,,,639543,8/29/2011 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.3969,-110.565,,8/24/2011 2:33:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,001109,,12/8/2011 7:00:00 AM,,,,,Teton,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along the hike, I contact 3 parties of visitors confirming smoke and location of fire. 1557- Arrive at fire and observe 6 inch flame lengths with active burning.  A visitor has been working to suppress the fire with little success. He reports people were sitting where the fire started he heard them cough.   Call in assessment and brief 2 firefighters. Fire looks to be man caused as I could find no lightning marks in surrounding trees. Start building fireline and suppress the fire using one back pack pump that we re-filled in a nearby pond.  The spray bar on the backpack pump did not work because of weeds in water so we dumped backpack water onto fire and refilled 6 times. Complete line around fire and cold trail the interior of the fire. Final fire size is approx. 10 x 10. 1652 call fire contained.

On 6/6/12 Smith and Koel hiked to the fire to check on it.  Smith was incident commander, while Koel was along as a hiking partner.  We left the fire cache at 0945, and arrived on scene at 1035.  Smith dug around in the fire, and cold trailed the edges but did not find any heat within or outside of the burn perimeter.  At 1055 a small film canister was found two feet away from the fire perimeter.  Smith opened it up, and found a few rolled joints and loose marijuana.  Smith called 700Fox via cell phone to determine best course of action.  Smith was told to carry film canister down to fire cache where Mammoth Patrol would pick it up later that afternoon.  We departed the fire at 1100 due to snow, wind, and lack of heat within the fire; we arrived back at the cache at 1145.  Eric Morey retrieved the film canister at 1300 that afternoon.  6/11/12 Smith narrative,  Becky Smith and Jess Page hiked in to the Beaver fire on Monday, June 11th at 1400 hours.  Upon arriving, we cold trailed the entire fire and found no heat.  After it was deemed the entire fire was cold, we pulled the fireline back into place and rehabilitated the fire area.

After parking my government vehicle, I approached the site on foot and stamped out the small (3 inch high) flames I saw at the base of that clump of grass and wild rose.  The fire barely covered an area of 1 square foot.  There was a smell of sulfur when the area was inspected more closely.  A few passersby stopped and offered water bottles to help extinguish the fire.  I also poured water from my personal water bottle on the site.

Jess Bryers ICT5, Greg Oyler ICT5(T), Tyler Kulla.  Saw evidence of some small trees torching from yesterday.  Fire mostly smoldering in surface fuels.   At 1130, crew of three landed at helispot on the North end of Cygnet Lake (at: N 44 40. 390� X W 110 37. 153�). Hiked into fire and flagged the way in with orange flagging. On the way in, crew placed a HOBO temperature sensor at: N 44 40. 279� X W 110 37.632�. At 1300 crew arrived at the Cygnet fire (at: N 44 40.046 X W 110 38.308). At that time, fire was smoldering and creeping in litter, duff, and heavy fuels around the fire. Fuels were still wet from last night�s rain. The whole perimeter was active. No significant growth occurred since discovery.  Crew took fuel samples and weather observations around fire area. By 1430, the fire activity increased. Open flame was intermittently observed and smoldering and creeping activity increased. Fuels are continuous on all flanks of the fire, but are especially heavy on the South West side. Crew left fire by 1600. No significant growth occurred while crew was observing fire.  08/12/2012 � Met with Dep. Supt. and Chief Ranger regarding managing the fire.  Reviewed FSPro runs and highlighted concerns regarding values at risk.  Powerlines to the north are a big concern, but we discussed options to continue to support Canyon if the power goes out.  Generator at Lake should be sufficient to run Canyon, especially if the tourist season begins to wind down in two weeks as it usually does.  Decision was made to go ahead with managing this fire to continue to meet resource management plan objectives.  FMO worked with SOPL (Lewelling) to update WFDSS to include preliminary management action points (maps).  Discussed plan to transition SOPL to ICT3 for the complex of fires being managed and have Cataldo be ICT3(t).  Entire area in YELL was very thick with smoke from CA, NV, and ID fires.  Visibility was less than 2 miles. 08/13/2012 � Transfer of fire command to LewellingICT3 and Cataldo ICT3(T). 08/15/2012 � FMO Krish has a conversation with the Structural Fire Department and requests that they pre-position irrigation pipe and the pump truck at Norris as contingency for protection of infrastructure values in the Norris to Canyon area. 08/14-16/2012 � minimal fire activity. 08/17/2012 - Fire is finally visable from Mt.

I performed as ICT 5 trainee under Bill Mayer, and Bodie Tobin. 17:00; We arrived at the Elk Plaza Communication Towers approximately 1.5 miles west of Mammoth (the road requires 4 wheel drive).  I gave a briefing, & we began hiking in approximately � mi. SW of the comm. Towers at a heading of 240.  We arrived on scene at 17:25.  The coordinates are: N 44 58.953� by W 110 43.505.  It is located between Beaver Ponds Trail, & Sepulcher Trail.  LCES was in place before we engaged the fire. The size up is as follows:  30� x 60 (spot) wild fire with 1� flame lengths, smoldering, & creeping through deep litter & duff, burning 100s & 1000hrs., & burning out roots, and at the base of 4� to 10� diameter  trees (spruce & fir).  Winds were out of the west (down slope down valley) 5-20 mph.  The adjacent fuels are cured out (though wet) grass (Mammoth had recently received .13� of rain), 1000hr. dead & down, and live spruce & fir.  The potential was low to moderate.  The fire had a predominately east aspect with a 0-20 degree slope.  The origin of the fire is unknown (the lightening map does show a couple strikes in that vicinity the previous day).  However, no sign of a lightning strike was observed.  A 2� x 2� fire circle that appears to be reminiscent of a possible unattended �warming fire� or �user fire� was evident.   We confirmed coordinates at 18:00 with dispatch. At all times, we were in radio contact.   We attacked  the fire:  removed several hazard trees, cut burning trees into pieces, cleared the perimeter of the fire, and put a line around it; consolidated the heavies (bone piled), and dry moped.  We exited the scene at 18:30. Returned to the vehicles, and were back in Mammoth & out of service by 19:30.  An AAR was conducted. On 10/17/12 at 09:30 we re-engaged the fire after ensuring LCES was in place.  The cold had knocked the fire down considerably.  The bone pile was consumed entirely.  We had the same crew, and two bladder bags.  We worked the stump holes, and other hot spots.  We utilized a nearby pond to refill our bladder bags.  At 12:00, I called the fire �contained�.

I requested to take Engine 1570 up the trail/road and he conferred with Chief Ranger Tim Reid and Deputy Superintendent Steve Iobst, and gave me the OK to drive the engine up Slough Cr. We loaded up in 1570 with Tripp, Kulla, Fleming and Bilbrey. Met Tower rangers 5D35 and his partner at the trailhead and let them know we�d report anyone we thought suspicious as this fire was an escaped illegal campfire. We arrived at the confluence of Plateau Creek and the Slough Cr. Trail at 1445 and were met by Dave from the Warriors and Whitewater program.  He walked me into the fire about 300yds from the engine. Present at the fire scene were about 10 men most of whom are wounded war veterans or employees of the Silver Tip Ranch. They had smelled and then spotted the smoke from the horse wagons as they passed by and taken action. They had put about 20 cooler drops of water from the nearby creek on the fire and halted its progress.  Dave told me that some of the guys were stomping out the fire with their prosthetics until he reminded them that they couldn�t feel their plastic feet and should stop. But they caught the fire, there was only three or four small smokes when I arrived. They had preserved the origin and gave me a description of a guy that had walked in �from out of nowhere� to the fire scene and then just turned around and left. They said he was a fisherman packing a Sage rod case and wearing a GoPro camera on his chest. We had seen and briefly spoke to the same individual on the drive in, so I called 5D35 on the radio and relayed this information. I then thanked all the men on scene and they went on their way up to the Silver Tip Ranch. 1500. I called to Kulla to bring the rest of the crew and a portable pump off of 1570 to the fire and they arrived 10 minutes later. Fleming and Bilbrey got the pump set up and we went about mopping up the rest of the fire. I took pictures of the origin and the rest of the scene and collected the material/ garbage around the makeshift fire ring. There was an empty isobutane/propane mini stove canister and some garbage next to the fire. This evidence was delivered to the Tower Ranger station.  1600. Fire is contained 1700-1830.

The structure protection plan for Flagg Ranch is unavailable. 8/9/2013 � Plan mission to fly into backcountry and post new backcountry closure information and install RAWS on fire.  New fire start, Druid Fire, 7TA flew w/Throop to size-up fire.  Light rain over area.  Install RAWS at South Entrance.  Assess structures at flag ranch.  Work on structure protection plan and meet with Chief Grey re: structures etc.  Sign posting mission finally happened in the afternoon. 9/10/2013 � Fly FX crew of 3 in to Harebell cabin to read monitoring plots.  We planned on flying a mission for Druid fire, but it was cancelled.  PIO Weaver was called to respond to a fire in ID with her type 1 team.

Once they arrived at the Lamar River Stock Trail Head 1207, IC was able to confirm lat long and location. DO was unable to get a face to face with management, so made the decision to suppress,  also due to the time of year, limited staffing, visibility and proximity to the NE corridor of unburned fuels leading directly to the NE entrance, Silver Gate and Cooke City.  IC and crew made their way to the fire across Lamar Valley at 1300 and were unable to ford the Lamar River at the Specimen Ridge trail ford.

Landed and did a grid down the hill and found the fire a short distance away. Found the fire in an old douglas fir log on the ground, it appeared to have been burning for a while. It appeared to be a natural ignition. They took suppression action and had 2TC drop a couple of buckets on it and mopped up the stump.

The powerline ignited a dead and down log that was lying on the ground beneath the powerline.  The fire became established in the down and dead log with mostly smoldering and creeping but would not burn the surrounding vegetation due to high moisture content in the grass.  The general public was the initial reporting party and also walked up to the fire(which was only 100 yards from the road)to see if they could put it out.  The public proceeded to disperse portions of the dead and down log so in their opinion it would go out.  Lake patrol(L16) was the second party on scene and instructed the general public to head back to the road and then he piled the logs into one area because some grass was beginning to burn with the burning logs laying directly on top of the vegetation.  Lake structure Engine 16 was next on scene and easily brought a hose to the fire and put roughly 300 gals of water on the burning logs.  E 16 also dug line around the burning material and made sure all hotspots were out and cold.  Wildland Fire Engine 691 from Mammoth was last on scene about 2.5 hrs from initial report.  E 691 tied in with L16 and E 16 and determined the fire out.  In the end the fire was about a 10th of an acre and burned mostly the dead and down log with a little grass being burned where the public had dispersed the logs.   FROM STRUCTURAL FIRE INCIDENT REPORT Lake Fire Company was paged to a fire caused by a downed power line at LeHardy Burn. E-5 responded with a crew of 2. E-4 responded with a crew of 2. Northwest Energy had arrived on scene prior to our arrival and cut power to the lines and advised us that the area was safe to begin fire suppression. The fire was approximately 5 yards wide by 15 yards long and actively burning in grass and downed wood. The fire area was approximately 200 yards uphill from the roadway. A hand line and hotel pack were deployed off E-5 and charged. FFs Amundson, Kelsey, and Fragua formed an attack team. The hose line was charged and the fire area was swept with water several times. FFs Fragua and Kelsey used hand tool to cut a fire break around the area. FFs Kelsey and Fragua turned the ground several times and smoldering was extinguished with water. All fire activity in the area was extinguished by 1500hrs. Lake Fire Company remained on scene and monitored the area until Mammoth Wild Land Fire arrived on scene at 1615hrs.

This fire scar is still only carrying fire under fire weather conditions on the very high to extreme end of the spectrum, such as sustained LP4 crown fire under a consistent 5 to 10 mph wind entering the edge of the fire scar.  There are few values at risk in the fire planning area. Pete Webster in CRO and Superintendent Dan Wenk are consulted and both concur with FMO/Duty Officer Cataldo to manage this fire long term for natural ecosystem processes and not to suppress it.  Fire is entered into WFDSS, and the YNP wildfire decision support tool is completed, signed, and scanned into WFDSS as well. Plans are made to monitor the fire with a remote camera on Mount Sheridan.   8/15-17/2014  Ongoing SAR priorities and unfavorable flying weather have resulted in the camera not being mounted on Mount Sheridan yet.  Plans are made to fly to the fire the next day and see if it persists and still has spread potential.  If so the camera will be mounted on Mount Sheridan. If the camera cannot be mounted then a lookout may be placed in the Mt. Sheridan Lookout to monitor the fire area for activity. 8/18/2014 Checked the fire with Helicopter 9TA.  No smoke or flame visible.  UTL fire.  Plan is to opportunistically monitor the fire area for activity with research aircraft that all already in the area so as not to incur additional risk.  9/1/2014 After no signs of activity for two weeks, the fire is declared out.",,,,,,JB9E,,,,,639593,9/2/2014 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.2465,-110.3675,,8/18/2014 6:00:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,001405,,11/12/2014 7:00:00 AM,,,,,Teton,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,480111,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When E-692 arrived on scene at approximately 1753, Old Faithful Ranger Matt Lovingier had command of the scene and was monitoring the fire from Firehole River Drive.  Old Faithful E-6 with McCoy and Derene were on scene and sprayed limited water across the river to keep the fire in check until fire investigation could be completed and qualified wildland personnel could suppress the fire.  The fire was suspected to be human caused.  Fireworks were found on the south side of the river along the road.  There was a report of 2 individuals across the river earlier in the day.  The fire was reported by a Canyon Maintenance worker and Dan Urie was second on scene.  Jessie Pike arrived on scene to help provide investigative the cause and provide subject matter expert guidance dealing with the swift water to be dealt with in crossing the firehole river.  Command was transferred to Mayer at approximately 1800. Mayer, Smith, and Pike scouted a suitable river crossing for accessing the fire utilizing hip boots.  Pike advised due to the current that PFDs should be worn due to the volume of water, the weight of the gear that we were carrying and the added weight of water that would be trapped in the hip boots if we were to fall.  Jeremy Ropp was called to bring additional PFDs from Old Faithful.  Pike located 2 PFDs in the Patrol cars on scene so Mayer and Pike crossed the river to access the fire. Once on scene, fire activity was minimal and size was approximately 30� X 40�.  We searched the scene and located 2 large bottle rockets, one in the fire perimeter and one in some rocks adjacent to the fire scene.  A collapsible bucket was used to bring water from the river to suppress the hot spots.  The perimeter was cold trailed.  All hot spots were 100% mopped up and cold trailed.  Due to the risk crossing the river, no chainsaw was on the fire scene, so no logs were bucked up, but mop-up was still adequate. The fire was declared contained and controlled at 1945 and the crew crossed the river and performed an AAR. The fire was assigned IMARS case number NP15038264. The fire was declared out on 05/14/2015 at 1615 by Mayer observing the fire from across the river with binoculars.",,,,,,JPP6,,,,,639594,5/15/2015 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.6369,-110.8647,,5/4/2015 1:09:00 AM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,001501,,6/11/2015 6:00:00 AM,,,,,Teton,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another person at Yack camp reports seeing fire through spotting scope and takes a picture. Dispatch attempts to contact Cataldo/Opperman, does not make contact, tries again next day.  8/16/15 Dispatcher Blaine Hoppe reports seeing fire driving to work.  At 0800, Cataldo assigns Hafer, Crouter, and Stenvers to locate the fire in E692, Hafer as IC, Crouter as trainee. Crew makes contact with Blaine Hoppe at dispatch to get an approximate location. Hoppe puts the fire on west side of Bunsen Peak, roughly halfway between the top of Cathedral rock and tree-line. At 0830, E692 sets up at Yack camp with spotting scope to try and locate fire. No signs of smoke, but made contact with locals who all report seeing fire in same location. E692 returns to base 1230. Hafer and Crouter make contact with Joe Beuter for a more detailed location. Beuter puts it in same spot, but closer to the top of the ridge. At 1500, Hafer and Crouter return to Yack camp to try and locate fire again, but see no smoke or signs of fire, return to cache at 1700.   8/19/15 At 1200, Cataldo assigned Allen as IC and Wallen as IC trainee and tasked us with hiking Bunsen Trail in search of fire. At 1330 we begin hiking Bunsen Trail. At approximately 1415 we locate a side trail with some soil disturbance at the third switchback facing Mammoth. At 1417 we located a small burn spot and then a few feet away a pile of rocks that covered a campfire. The campfire was ringed in small rocks. We checked the fire for any indications of heat and found none. One can of beans was left in the fire and we packed it out. Upon further scouting of the site we located some small bits of string and a single led pen light. It did not appear that the individuals that made the campfire slept on the ground but slept from hammocks suspended from nearby trees. We also located two uprooted saplings (<4�) but could not locate where they originated. Photos were taken of the campfire ring and surrounding area. We determined this to be the fire that was reported on 8/15/15 as no other campfires were discovered from further scouting of the surrounding area all the way to Bunsen Peak and with the freshness of the burned material and ground disturbance. We departed Bunsen trail at 1622 for cache.

At 1202 per Cataldo, a helicopter with bucket is requested but none are available. At 1215, 7L15 has a boat ready for firefighter transportation at Bridge Bay Marina. The assumption is that the fire is human caused because of location at a campsite. Suppression will be aggressive. At 1300 Allen, Stenvers, and Bueter leave Mammoth for Bridge Bay Marina and then depart on vessel for fire. Allen assumes IC of fire and arrives on scene at 1555. Single and group tree torching is observed with south flank of fire most active. Fire is mosaic in pattern with fingers and smoldering/creeping on north flank. Estimate 1-5 acres. Winds are 1-10 and steady from the south west and fire is in Lodgepole, Spruce/fir with regen and very dense. There are numerous snags with very heavy dead and down jackstraw. Navigating fire is difficult due to dead and down. We investigate the campsite and determine that the fire did not originate there. Fire ring is cold. No evidence of anyone having been there for days. There are no trails leading from campsite to fire location. Fire perimeter is approximately 3 to 4 chains from campsite but moving towards campsite. Ember wash from torching is creating small spot fires ahead of fire. Scout the interior of the fire looking for potential origin/lightning strike but fire consumption prevents this, none located. While we are on the north flank of the fire, the intensity picks up on south flank and fire spreads to lake shore and 5L4 campsite. At approximately 1635 Grand Teton ship 38HX is enroute to fire and at 1650 arrives on scene and does a size-up of fire and determines fire to be 3 acres with spot fires ahead of fire. We determine that it will take multiple crews and air resources to suppress fire. At 1708, 38HX is released and returning to GRTE. Fire is now to be a managed fire, no suppression actions to occur and fire is disengaged. IC and crew are ordered to return back to Mammoth and depart scene at 1715. Fire is putting up decent column, much more visible now and can still be seen from a far distance across lake.   8/25/2015 Smith took over as IC of fire on 8/25/15.  Smith, Stenvers, and Bueter left cache at 1100 and drove to the Fishing Bridge area.  Stopped at the Fishing Bridge Visitor Center, Fishing Bridge General Store, Fishing Bridge RV Park, and the Lake Hotel to drop off maps and inform of fire.  No one was aware of the fire, except the Visitor Center who had only heard rumors of it as they do not have phones or internet at this time.  Drove down to Gull Point Drive to find a decent place to observe fire; Frank Island was in the line of sight and therefore the fire was not visible.  Tried parking near Indian Lake with decent view of fire, but ended up on the beach near the Visitor Center at 1400 with the best view of the fire.  At 1405 3L65 (fisheries employee) reported group tree torching on the fire.  There were a large amount of thunderstorms passing through the area all afternoon, and when fire would get solar radiation (i.e., wasn�t covered by a cloud) it would start putting up some smoke indicative of single and group tree torching.  Left area at 1730; fire is estimated to be between 10 and 100 acres.  A press release went out today, and a boat ride was set up for 8/26/15 to get firefighters on the ground and assist with gathering of fire acoustics.  8/26/2015 Boat ride to fire with Smith, Bueter, Stenvers, Jerrett (audio) and Herbert (film) was canceled today due to weather.  No monitoring took place, and no reports came in about smoke or flames visible.  8/27/2015 At 1100 a fisheries boat in the South Arm of the Lake reported some smoke from the fire, but no active flames visible.

The fire was paged and within two minutes 5A20 arrived on scene. At 1248 Yellowstone employees working close by came over to assist putting the flames out with rakes and shovels. At 1251 E1 +4, E691 +2 (Mayer and Bell), Hafer and Chartier arrived at the incident. E1 rolled out hose and began putting water on the fire while Fire Cache personnel wet mopped the area with tools. The fire was small enough that no additional resources were needed and the existing personnel were able to put it out themselves. At 1308 the fire was 100% contained and 1500 the fire was reported out per command. The Plumber fire started due to a Yellowstone employee cutting metal pipe and sending sparks into the area of dry grass. The employee immediately made a phone call to dispatch and recruited other employees working close by to assist in putting out the flames.",,,,,,J3FS,,,,,639602,9/11/2015 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.9675,-110.697,,9/10/2015 6:48:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,001509,,11/25/2015 7:00:00 AM,,,,,Park,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,480111,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On Friday Aug 5th a recon flight was conducted by YNP hellitack at 08:00 hrs.  Helitack confirmed that there was a fire in the area and reported it at around 1 ac and burning with minimal fire behavior in a stand of spruce.  At 11:30 the three person YNP Fire Effects team was flown into the fire and arrived on scene at the fire at 12:30.  Flying into the fire the team also observed minimal fire behavior with a couple torched trees.  Arriving on scene FX reconed and GPSed the fire perimeter.  The GPS tracks showed the fire perimeter at 1.1 ac.  Also the team found that the fire was burning in a predominantly douglas fir and true fir stand with creeping and smoldering fire in the duff and litter with individual immature firs torching, the fire was extinguishing in live green fuel.   The team estimated there to be actively creeping and smoldering fire on 60-75 % of the fire perimeter.  The team collected fuel samples from the representative fuel and observed that fire behavior diminished from 12:30-1600 as cloud cover increased.  At 16:00 the team hiked back to the LZ for their 17:00 pick up.  While at the LZ waiting for pick up the team observed the fire column increase in volume and lift and change from white to black indicating increased fire behavior and sustained torching of live trees.  Upon pick up the team conducted on more fly around of the fire and confirmed the increase in fire behavior with a sustained flame front in the dead and down and numerous mature fir trees torching, green meadows appeared to continue to retard fire spread.   Helitack also flew into the Fawn Pass cabin and performed a ground recon of effort and equipment needed to protect the structure.  It is included in fire folder.  Supplies are cached together in the fire garages for easy access. 8/6/16 Significant fire activity and growth today commencing around 1600.  Estimated fire at 500+ acres as of 1830.  Cataldo initiated coordinating ordering of PIO support with Park PAO Morgan Warthin.  Availability of logistics support checked for Jerry Ryder and Lloyd Kortge in the event that PIOs need a base camp established due to lack of rooms in local commuting area.  Coordination with Central Backcountry Office on campsite and trail closures continued.  Recommended closing WB 1, WB3, WB4, and WB6 sites, as well as, Fawn and Bighorn Pass trails for several miles on either side of the fire.  Hard copies of emails in fire folder. Cabin Protection Kit and personnel (Clark +3) dispatched to the Fawn Pass Cabin area around 1730 hrs.  Unable to fly into cabin due to passing afternoon thunderstorms. 0.16 of precipitation fell at Quadrant RAWS.  Transition to ICT4 Plovanic from ICT5 Clark tomorrow morning at 0700. 8/7/16 Nick Plovanic is now Fawn ICT4.  IC plus 3 into Fawn Pass cabin to implement protection measures.  PIO support ( 4 personnel) on a  resource order.  Monitoring camera to be ordered tomorrow morning, cache is closed today.  Dan Warthin unavailable to assist.  Checking availability on misc. Type 3 support personnel (Jeansonne, Taber, Kortge, Ryder).  Fire info signage approved for purchase.  Local PIO support (Cudmore and Reid) helping incident today along with Morgan Warthin.  Cabin crew elected to overnight at cabin and has made good progress on protection plan.  0.29 24-hour total rainfall on this fire.  Minimal spread today, burning in heavy logs mostly. 8/8/2016 Plovanic +3 flown out of fire.  Minimal fire behavior or growth.  Cabin prep is complete.

Smoke and flames were reported by visitors and a park ranger near the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. 700 Fox identified the approximate location based upon a lightning strike map. Coordinates were relayed and Engine 692�Plovanic plus three�was dispatched to the location. The crew stopped at Pumice Point to scout the fire from across the lake. No smoke was visible, so they continued on to the given coordinates. Driving past the identified location, they smelled smoke, though none was visible, and pulled off the road to hike in and investigate. Approximately 100 yards from the road in Potts Basin, the crew of Engine 692 found the fire. They arrived on scene at 1645 and identified four shoebox-sized pockets of heat in dead-and-down and timber litter in a mature lodgepole-spruce-fir stand. The fire was less than a tenth of an acre with 50% of the perimeter still active. It seemed to originate from a lightning strike near a snag and a 40ft fir that torched but were now cold. Wind was light, less than 5 mph, coming from the East. The fire was located on the eastern aspect of a mild slope (approximately 5%). The surrounding grass and reprod fuels were noticeably moist. With the size-up and LCES completed, the crew radioed information to 700 Fox and got permission to engage and suppress the fire. A hose lay was established from Engine 692. The crew mopped up the four spots. Once they were cold, the fire was called in contained at 1800. The crew gridded the surrounding area and failed to find any other heat. They called in the fire controlled at 1830, packed up their equipment, and drove back to Mammoth. 08-31-17 The crew arrived back on scene at 1330, found the spots completely cold, and called it out at 1400.",,,,,,LA29,,,,,639633,9/1/2017 5:59:59 AM,,,NRCC,,,0,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,1/30/2023 4:30:04 PM,,0,,44.42691,-110.57579,,8/29/2017 10:47:00 PM,,,,,,,0,,0,,1,001706,,9/4/2017 6:00:00 AM,,,,,Teton,MTBDC,,,NPS,Federal,NPS,,US-WY,,,480113,,,Incomplete,,-7,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was suppressed due to time of year and location east of highway 191 which had been determined by NPS and USFS management as too close to USFS protection values to manage with any strategy except full suppression this early in the fire season.  Keeping the Bacon Rind fire west of highway 191 was an objective of that incident. CWN Helicopter 2TC and a crew of 4 personnel were shuttled into the fire and contained it before nightfall.  One crewmember was evacuated after dark by a life flight due to excessive cramping.  Crew was swapped out with smokejumpers, who hiked in, the next day due to fatigue associated with the medical incident in the middle of the night.  Excessive PT during that day prior to the IA, steep conditions, and lack of hydration were identified as potential causal factors precipitating the medical incident.

Nearby Xanterra employees responded with a fire extinguisher while structural fire arrived and set up a hose line. Approximately 1000 gallons of water was used to successfully suppress the fire. E692 with IC Plovanic, IC trainee Koehler, and Fitzgerald arrived at scene and was briefed by 5H11 as command was transferred. The fire was checked by E692 and found to be cold.  The incident was less than 1/10th of an acre in grasses, and had escaped from a known employee campfire ring. The fire had creeped South East downhill towards a small creek, and burned the perimeter of the area. Fire potential was high, due to high winds, dry fuel, steep aspect, and proximity of power substation and Mammoth Village.

At this time, fire activity is not active enough near the Cache Creek trail or any camp sites for an area closure. With approval of the Park Superintendent, the fire will be monitored with no suppression actions taken due to the lack of values in the area to protect and fires are a benefit to Yellowstone's ecosystem.

The Hitching Post fire was likely ignited by lightning on the 25th of July and first detected on the 26th by a visitor.  It is located approximately 5.5 miles south of the Northeast entrance road and 1/2 mile east of the Lamar River trail (44° 47.7'N x 110° 07.16'W).   

The fire is currently estimated at 1/2 an acre in size and smoldering in duff and Douglas fir. On the morning of the 27th, six Yellowstone firefighters attempted to access the incident on foot, and a fixed-wing fire detection aircraft was launched out of Bozeman, Montana to assist in pinpointing its exact location. The detection flight finally spotted light smoke at around 1300 hrs, but due to steep inaccessible terrain the ground forces were unable to access the incident yesterday.  

On morning of 28th of July, an NPS helicopter GRCA 8PA) and 3-person flight crew currently based out of Grand Teton National Park flew into the fire area, and obtained a more complete size-up of the incident. Based on the location, time of year, terrain, and low spread potential a confinement strategy is being employed to manage this incident.  The Helitack personnel will use minimum suppression tactics today commensurate with the low fire behavior and spread potential to maintain the fire at its current size.  

The helitack crew reported no perimeter heat and some heat remaining in the duff/litter underneath interior douglas fir.  They walked the perimeter and used MIST tactics to secure anything that may pose a threat to the fire remaining within it’s current perimeter.

No personnel remained on the incident overnight on the 28th, and we do not intend to staff the incident again unless additional activity is detected.  There are no closures anticipated in association with this incident.

7/29 Fire crew (Janecko +1) monitored fire from NE Entrance Road, no activity was able to be detected.
7/30 Fire crew (Bealka +2) monitored fire from NE Entrance Road, no activity was able to be detected.
8/5 Helitack with 4BH flew the incident and reported no visible smokes, they then landed and walked the fire and found no heat. The incident was controlled and called out on 8/5. The fire gained no acreage from first size perimeter reported.

In the initial report, 700F relayed that 5N31 was the reporting party. By way of ""rock, paper, scissors"" I was the ICT-5 trainee for this fire with Harms as actual. Lynch, Hulse, Harms and I drove to a pullout near Petrified Tree where we met up with 5N31. We could see what appeared to be a single tree smoking from the road. While speaking with 5N31 another park employee arrived and led us to a parking area closer to the fire. 

Once parked, we put on our funky yellows, slid into our packs and lumbered to the fire with sawyer Harms leading the way. When we arrived it was clear our snag had been struck by lightning. The trunk had a defined mark and tree bits were spread like confetti on the ground. The tree was mostly smoking with whispers of orange flames every now and then on the lower 1/4. I called 700F and gave an update and quick size up. At that point, the overcast sky started to loom. I radioed 700F for Duty Officer's plan of action and a weather update. The answers were; try to get the tree on the ground or dig line around the tree and we were on the edge of a cell. We established safety zones and escape routes and got to work. 

While Harms fell the tree, Hulse was weather watch. As harms got the tree on the ground we began to hear thunder. While Harms cut some smoldering rounds off the tree, we noticed some duff and bark at the base burning. We quickly dug line around the base and Harms low stumped the tree. At this point, the lightning had started. We hot footed it out of there as the rain began

On 6/10/24 Harms, Marquez, Lampe and Ecker lifted from Mammoth the Mile Post 17 fire. The helicopter landed at Helispot 1. Once on the ground, Marquez, Lampe and Ecker hiked to the fire approximately 1.25 miles downhill. The terrain had snow, inescapable downed trees and spiderwebs between standing trees at regular intervals. The party arrived at the fire in just under 3 hours and did a quick hike around the fire which appeared to be mostly cold. The fire was started by lightening that struck several trees and a downed log approximately 15 feet away.

At this point, Lampe and Ecker began improving a helispot closer to the fire and Marquez proceeded to the fire. Marquez called in a size up to 700F then began cold trailing the fire. After approximately one hour the helispot was finished and Lampe directed 4BH for landing. Once on the ground, Harms joined the cold trailing effort with Marquez, Ecker, and Lampe. Approximately 3 hours after arrival to the fire Marquez called it in as “contained” to 700F. After one last look at hot spots by Ecker, 4BH lifted from Helispot 2 for Mammoth Helibase.

7/19 – The fire was located on a detection flight by helicopter 4 N234BH.  Initial size up was called up and helicopter returned to mammoth helibase after recon of potential landing zone and water source.  Duty officer instructed the IC to suppress the fire.  Helicopter 4BH was used to shuttle four personnel to fire.  At the helispot bucket was hooked to helicopter to begin ops but 4BH had to return to helibase with bucket issues, 4BH would return after swapping buckets putting approximately 4000 gallons on the fire in close coordination with the ground crew.  Ground crew constructed an anchor at the heel and began stopping forward progression and securing the flanks.  Ground crews where able to stop any further growth of the fire successfully with the fire staying at about 0.5 acres in size.  After growth was stopped crews put in saw line, got all heavy fuels on the ground and put in hand line where necessary.  Ground crews were then shuttled out with 4BH.
7/20 – Ground crew was shuttled into the same helispot.  Thanks to the previous shifts work the fire had not grown at all and showed no obvious heat or smoke.  Saw and hand line was improved and the whole fire was cold trailed.  Finding no heat or smoke the fire was called contained at 1400 and controlled.  Ground crew continued to monitor the fire for any heat or smoke in direct sunlight until 4BH was able to shuttle the ground crew back to helibase.

On 7/23/24 at 15:35 a call from Dispatch was received by Abraham Harms informing us of a smoke report along highway 191 on the west side of the road. 
4BH Launched with Abe Harms (HMGB), Kat Janecko (IC5) and Curtis Propst (IC5-T). 
The Smoke was sighted at 1547. 4BH Circled the fire for a few moments to build a proper size up given by Propst (IC5T). A Dip site in Grayling Creek was located by the crew at 1600. An LZ was identified at 1603. The Crew unloaded and reconfigured the ship for bucket work. The Crew hiked uphill towards the fire while waiting for approval to suppress or manage the fire as well as dip site approval. At 1630 the word came back that the dip site was approved, and the fire was to be suppressed. Abe Harms began plugging in and cutting saw line in the timber while Kat and Curtis Anchored at the bottom of the fire at a rock face and began to wrap the fire with handline. A Small spot (2’x3’) was addressed by the grubbers. 
At 1719 while looking for more spots Propst noticed a new start a few miles away on the other side of the highway. It was called in to 700Fox and approval was given to send 4BH to the area to look at it and give a quick size up to dispatch while the crew continued operations on the MP 18 Fire. Approval for 4BH to utilize the bucket and dip site on the new fire was given at 1730 and 4BH was released to knock the New Start down. After puttin’ a hurtin’ on The New Start 4BH returned to MP 18 and continued bucket work until 1930. The Ground crew called dispatch and declared the MP18 Fire contained at 2000 then reconfigured the ship for the return shuttle and flew back to helibase. 4BH was back on the ground and shut down at 2030.
7/24/24
Yellowstone helitack sent a short squad consisting of Abe Harms (IC5), Curtis Propst (IC5-T) and Caitlin Marquez to continue engaging the MP18 Fire at 1030. Boots were on the ground and plugged back into operations at 1103. Saw Line was buffed and improved as well as handline. Mop-up operations began with crew members Gridding for heats and checking probable areas of heat and heavies throughout the early afternoon. Some Bone piling was done to burn some heavies down to a manageable mopup size.
4BH was released by a nearby Incident at 1330 to assist MP 18 with a few buckets before the fuel cycle was too low. 4BH delivered two buckets to assist with Mop-up before dropping the bucket off at the LZ down the hill and returning to Mammoth for Fuel. After evaluating the need for water, the crew decided to release 4BH until they would need a pickup to leave. Mopup continued and heats were declared out. A weather report was requested from Dispatch due to Cumulus build up to the North and West. The Weather report showed storms moving in. at 1445 IC5-T requested 4BH to return to the MP18 to begin a shuttle off the hilltop back to mammoth. The Crew hiked to the LZ and met 4BH, loaded up and was back on the ground in Mammoth at 1532. The fire was declared contained and controlled at 1545 by IC5 and IC5-T.

7/23 – Fire was located by Propst while on the Milepost 18 Fire.  Fire was reported and helicopter N234BH was sent to recon it and started bucket work on it at 1729.  4BH worked it with buckets until 1830.  No boots where on the ground at the fire on 7/23.
7/24 – At 0930 a morning recon with the IC5(t), squaddies and the DO took place due to concerns about the safety of inserting personnel into an environment with potentially poor or non-existent safety zone.  Adequate safety zones and escape routes were found and the decision was made to insert 6 personnel in 2 loads into a large wet meadow, which would be the helispot and our safety zone.  The helispot and safety zone were about 1/3 of a mile from the fire.  The first 3 were inserted at 1130 and engaged at 1145.  At 1215 the second load landed.  When they arrived at the fire we stopped for a full brief.  Bucket work started at 1240, we shared the bucket ship, 4BH, with the Milepost 18 Fire for a full bucket cycle.  Fire was contained with saw line, bucket work and water from the nearby creek using bladder bags.  The fire consisted of 8 separate spots totaling to about .5 acres.  The given coordinates are of the largest spot.  The rest of the spots extend north about 100 yards on both sides of the creek.  Around 1500 the decision was made to leave both Milepost 18 and the Camp Creek Fires due to weather.  The first load left the fire at 1600 and the second was away at 1630.  The fire was called contained later that evening.

Yellowstone Helitack was notified of a smoke report and S.A.R. in the same area of Bechler at 
1045. After receiving a patient update and configuring for the patient and I.A. The plan was to fly to the 
smoke, drop off Harms and Hulse, then Marquez and pilot would retrieve the patient and transport them 
to Old Faithful. Curtis Propst was to drive Heli 1 the ball field behind the fuel truck driver. Once patient 
care was transferred, 4BH would refuel at the ball field and take Marquez and Propst to the fire. 
Harm and Hulse were dropped off at the fire at 1200 while Marquez and 4BH went to the SAR. 
Harms was IC actual. On arrival Harms and Hulse established L.C.E.S. and improved the helispot. The size 
up occurred at 1300. The west flank was the most active. Harms and Hulse found an anchor and began 
cutting operations on the west flank. Harms cut while Hulse swamped. 
At 1445, 4BH, Marquez and Propst arrived at the helispot and reconfigured for buckets. At 1450 
4BH began bucket operations. Marquez and Propst hiked to fire and are tied in at 1500. The IC-t position 
was transferred to Marquez with Harms as actual. Bucket work continued. At 1520 Harms and Propst 
begin felling operations for a closer helispot. Felling operations for better helispot are deemed futile by 
Marquez and shut down after 1545.
At 1535 Marquez completed a perimeter check. Buckets continue. At 1826 Marquez and Hulse 
began cold trailing the west flank and “connecting the dots” with line in areas of heat. Harms and Propst 
began cutting on the East flank. Buckets continue for 51 total buckets. The second cold trailing of fire 
perimeter begins. 
Harms, Noah and Propst hike to the helispot and reconfigure the ship to begin personnel
shuttling operations. Noah and Propst fly to the ball field and drive Heli one back to Mammoth. At 2000 
4BH returned to the Wyodaho fire to pick up Marquez and Harms and return to Mammoth Helibase. On 
until 2230.
8/7/24
4BH arrived at the Wyodaho fire at 1030 with Marquez, Propst and Harms. Marquez and Propst 
hiked to the fire and began checking the perimeter for heat. 4BH and Harms went to the ball field to pick 
up Hulse and Cook, who drove Heli 1. 
Harms, Hulse and Cook returned to the fire on 4BH. Hulse and Cook hiked to the fire while 
Harms reconfigured the ship for buckets. 
At 1130 Hulse and Marquez begin cold trailing the west flank while Propst and Cook begin cold 
trailing the east flank. Cold trailing continues until 1245. At that time Propst and Hulse begin saw 
operations, improving line and removing bucket obstacles. At 1315, bucket operations begin on 
remaining hot spots. Cook and Marquez directed buckets while Hulse and Propst continue cutting. 4BH 
dropped a total of 11 buckets. At 1400, Marquez, Cook, Propst and Hulse begin gridding the west flank. 
At 1430 Harms arrives and assists gridding the east flank. 
At 1500, Hulse, Harms and Cook hike to the helispot and reconfigure the ship for shuttling. At 
1530 Hulse and Cook fly to the ball field and begin driving Heli 1 back to Mammoth. 4BH returned to the 
helispot, and picked up Propst,Harms and Marquez then returned to Mammoth Helibase.

The park ship 4BH gave a size up, but did not engage the fire. The following day 9/5/24, Yellowstone Helitack was dispatched to the Lovely Fire. 4BH departed Mammoth at 0831 with a crew of 3 plus pilot. The fire was located and was .1 acres and was smoldering in dead/down and grass. Once the fire was scouted 4BH began looking for a dip site. The dip 
site of Tern Lake was identified and a request to dip out of it was made. 4BH then landed and shut down about .5 miles down hill from the fire at 0941. Noah Brueggeman-Hulse was IC 5 trainee with Matt Mason as actual. Helitack then hooked up the bucket and began to hike in. A radio was left with the pilot to order bucket work if needed. Helitack arrived at the Lovely Fire at 1014. Dispatched was notified and the IC established and assigned tasks and objectives. A ground size up was given by IC Bruggeman-Hulse at 1018 and is as follows:
Fire name: Lovely Fire
Location: 44°38.812 by -110°7.212
Perimeter Active: 10%
Size: .1 acer
Wind: 0-5 mph
Wind Direction: SW Variable
Fuel Type: Slash, Grass
Adjacent Fuels: Slash, Grass, Lodgepole
Aspect: West
Position on Slope: Upper 1/3
Spread Potential: Low to Moderate
Estimated Number of Personnel to Control: 3
Estimated Commitment: 3 Hours
Equipment Needs: None
Structures Threatened: None
Special Information: 4BH Standing by for bucket work
The fire consisted of mainly one large down tree, smaller dead and down, grass and a stump. Next 
Helitack engaged the fire by bucking heavies, cutting smaller trees near or in the black and securing the perimeter. Sections with heat were put in the black and scraped. Once all the fuels with heat were found and moved into the black, the decision was made to order 4BH for bucket work at 1040. The dip site was 7 miles away and the turn around time was 10 min +. Helitack was able to work in between drops and mix. The drops proved effective at cooling the heat. Due to fuel considerations 4BH landed and shut down after 3 buckets where dropped, 2 were on the fire. Mop up continued with Helitack cold trailing and looking for heats. No major heats were found after the bucket drops. Helitack then began to monitor the fire and see if any heats stood up. After 30 minutes without finding and further heats the decision was made to call the fire contained (Later Changed to Controlled) at 1230. Helitack then hiked 
off the fire and tied back in with the ship at 1256. 4BH with crew were back in Mammoth at 1347.

The Smoke report was received early in the morning and Yellowstone Helitack went down to stage at Old Faithful helispot. 4BH was down for maintenance, so the helitack crew (Williams, Clulow, Marquez) picked up by Pocatello helitack in helicopter 9GF. 9GF flew over Cutoff fire, I completed an ariel sizeup and sent it to 700F. 9GF landed at LZ, and we began the hike into fire.  We arrived on scene and notified 700F. Clulow began digging line around fire, I mapped and began a more detailed sizeup. Sizeup was completed and sent to 700F. The fire consisted of three separate wildfires, each being labeled Cutoff 1, 2 & 3. Trees were dropped around cutoff 1 and line construction continued, focusing on cutoff 1. Cutoff 1 was the most active with creeping and smoldering, some visible flame. Each fire was 30ft x 30ft, with cutoff 3 being 45ft x 30ft. All three spots were circled by handline by the end of the day. Containment continued, and the weather reading took place. Hiked back to camp, which was next to LZ. We had dinner, and food was hung in a bag to prevent bear incursions.
The crew woke up at 0600 and had breakfast. We hiked to the fire and continued mop up. All three spots called controlled by 0900. We requested exfill and supplies, but there were no aircraft available. We continued to mop up but made a plan that by 1600 we would filter a nearby water source. 1600 rolled around, and 4BH came and picked us up. Returned to mammoth helibase.

Helitack was engaged on the South Pitchstone fire in the Southern area of the park. The Moss creek fire was East of Mt. Washburn right below Joesph’s Coat geological monitoring station. Marlee was the IC(t) and Abraham Harms was the IC actual. Marlee sized up the fire from the air, it was about .5 acres burning on the edge of the Broad Fire scar in a Spruce, Lodgepole mix forest. There was heavy dead and down with moderate spread potential. We landed above the fire in the saddle we use to get to geological monitoring station. We also ordered a load of jumpers after we landed. 
The helicopter started bucket work immediately and knocked down most of the fire concern by end of shift. There were a few areas of single tree spotting and it had potential to get up and be a larger problem but we were able to manage it. The jumpers arrived and were briefed by Marlee and plugged into working the fire. 
We had a minor green medical when one of our firefighters somehow impaled his arm with the pointed end of a chainsaw file. Marlee being an emt determined that it was better to remove the object in the field than leave it in. It was about an inch into the outer layer of skin on the forearm. Marlee bandaged him up and we had him take it easy until we could get him out of there, since it was deemed a green medical. In hindsight we should have just flown him out as soon as we could.
By end of shift on day one all other Helitack personnel flew off the fire and it was just myself, Marlee, and 6 smokejumpers. We camped near the fire and observed minor fire behavior into the night. 
8/5/25
Mop up and bone piling started. Moss creek was nearby and I scouted to it to see if we could get a hose lay from it. (Jumper’s idea) I found that there was water and so we put together a pump order and sent it in to dispatch. Once we received the pump and hose order the jumpers put in a P line to the creek and we plumbed it. After getting water to the fire we were able to fully mop up and by end of shift there were only a few areas of heat left on the fire. 
8/6/25 
We continued to mop up and monitor the fire and determined that it was contained/ controlled. We packed up the hose and pump kits and worked on getting them back hauled. All resources were flown off the fire by end of shift and the fire was placed into contained/ controlled status.

The arial size up revealed a single tree lightening strike fire that was approximately 1/10 of an acre in an area thick with lodgepole regen. The fire was smoldering and creeping in the duff and the stricken tree that fell.
We landed at an unnamed pond nearby and reconfigured for buckets. While the pilot was performing buckets, I hiked into the fire. The hike was about a 7-minute walk from our helispot. Upon my arrival at the fire, I began directing bucket drops.
After 19 buckets, I called the fire contained. My generous estimation was that 3 people with a chainsaw and 3 hours could get this start into control status. We left the incident for the next one.
The following day myself and Curtis Propst flew to the Osprey Fire. An aerial size up revealed no smoke or other indications of heat. I estimated we would need 20 minutes to put the fire into controlled status.
We were dropped off and began hiking to the fire. At the fire we discovered a completely cold site! Not an iota of heat anywhere.
I called it controlled, contained and out within 20 minutes of drop off, as estimated.",,,,,,S83T,,,,,1349811,9/19/2025 6:00:00 PM,,,NRCC,,,38452381,8/18/2025 11:36:01 PM,11/24/2025 11:22:45 PM,jcataldo_nifc,0,Full Suppression,,,NPS,8/18/2025 3:30:00 PM,,,,0,1,1,0,,0,0,1,250026,INFORM_Inspector,11/18/2025 9:42:05 PM,,,,,Park,MTBDC,56029,,NPS,Federal,NPS,WYYNP,US-WY,Timber,TL3,,,,Certified,,-7,,,0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
